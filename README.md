# alltheplaces.xyz
The website for All The Places.

This repository contains static resources only.

Data for the website is built each week via a [run\_all\_spiders.sh](https://github.com/alltheplaces/alltheplaces/blob/master/ci/run_all_spiders.sh) script which is part of the [alltheplaces](https://github.com/alltheplaces/alltheplaces) repository.

The map on the website is built each week via a separate build process which is detailed in the [alltheplaces-serve](https://github.com/jleedev/alltheplaces-serve) repository.
